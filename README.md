# OpenCV-projects
This repository is my personal learning journey with OpenCV. I am starting from zero, so you will find everything from very basic image operations (drawing, filtering, transformations) to more advanced topics like feature detection, object recognition, CUDA acceleration, and deep learning with OpenCV.
